1. TITANIC-SURVIVAL_PREDICTION

   A machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal 
 measurements, built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn 

2. IRIS_FLOWER_PETAL_PREDICTION

   A model built using the titanic dataset that predicts whether  passenger on the titanic survived or not, tha dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers such as their age ,gender ,ticket class ,fare, cabin etc. and whether they survived or not.

3. CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION

    A machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions, follows a structured approach involving data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model training using a classification algorithm, and evaluating performance metrics.
